NPM (Node Package Manager) is a powerful tool included with Node.js that helps developers manage dependencies (libraries, packages, or modules) for their JavaScript projects. It is the largest software registry in the world and plays a central role in JavaScript development.

Key Features of NPM:
Package Management:

Allows developers to install, update, and manage third-party JavaScript libraries and tools easily.
Dependency Management:

Automatically resolves and installs dependencies for a project, ensuring everything works seamlessly.
Script Execution:

Provides a way to define and run custom scripts (e.g., starting a server, running tests) using npm run.
Publishing Packages:

Developers can create their own libraries and publish them to the NPM registry for others to use.
Global and Local Installation:

Global installation: Installs tools globally on your system, accessible from any project.
Local installation: Installs dependencies specific to a project.
Basic Commands:
Initialize a Project:

bash
Copy code
npm init
Creates a package.json file to manage project metadata and dependencies.

Install a Package:

bash
Copy code
npm install <package-name>
Installs a package and adds it to the node_modules folder.

Install a Package Globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g <package-name>
Installs a package system-wide.

Remove a Package:

bash
Copy code
npm uninstall <package-name>
Update a Package:

bash
Copy code
npm update <package-name>
